# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions

Here are my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) puzzles,
written in Python.

I have organized the code into folders. Each folder contains a `main.py` or two files named `part1.py` and `part2.py`.
It depends on how much code is reusable. Some days have tests as it was harder to debug the code without tests.

I have not included the input files in the repository, as requested by Advent of Code team.
See the [FAQ section](https://adventofcode.com/about) for more details.

You can download the input files from the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) website.

Feedback or suggestions are welcome.
